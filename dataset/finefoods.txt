review/summary: Good Quality Dog Food
review/text: I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.

review/summary: "Delight" says it all
review/text: This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.

review/summary: Nice Taffy
review/text: I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.

review/summary: Best of the Instant Oatmeals
review/text: McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.

review/text: This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.

review/summary: Oatmeal For Oatmeal Lovers
review/text: McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.

review/summary: Hearty Oatmeal
review/text: This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again.

review/summary: You'll go nuts over Ass-Kickin' Peanuts.
review/text: This wasn't in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.<br /><br />The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.<br /><br />You'll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin' Peanuts.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. He'll be so insulted.

review/summary: Hammer Nutrition 's Fizz Rocks!
review/text: I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a "salty" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.

review/text: For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The "zero carb" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....

I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.

review/text: Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/summary: Forget Molecular Gastronomy - this stuff rockes a coffee creamer!
review/text: I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured "food" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.

She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.

review/summary: Great Dog Food!
review/text: My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.

review/text: I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more "bang for your buck" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!

review/summary: Perfect for our English Bulldog with Allergies
review/text: My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef).

I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says "only 60 calories per jar!" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: My every day green tea
review/text: I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays "NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays "CAFFENE FREE".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.

review/summary: So Far So Good
review/text: I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.

My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more!

She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.

review/text: Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.

review/text: I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.

review/summary: Great value and convenient ramen
review/text: Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale.

review/text: I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store.

It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)

review/text: I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.

review/text: Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!

review/text: The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little "stuffing" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found "none" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF "STUFF" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S.

This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really "takes the cake" with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!

This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad.

After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff.

review/summary: Great product to help you sleep
review/text: WE have been looking for "natural" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule. Yes, we'd probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice. This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me. After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome.

review/summary: Perfect for gluten-free chocolate chip cookies
review/text: We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.

review/summary: Make a fresh fruit tart, light and beautiful
review/text: This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something "strawberry" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively "healthy" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.

review/summary: A huge hit at the office!
review/text: I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to. Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet. When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn't make it easy to deal with).

review/text: To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints. They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and that's as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints.

review/text: we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.

review/text: I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it. Clearly, mine does.

review/summary: Great For Fat Cats and Senior Citizens
review/text: We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we'd give it a try for our cats.  I'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really "feeling better" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it'll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.

review/summary: CHANGED FORMULA MAKES CATS SICK!!!!
review/text: As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get "upset" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!

review/summary: More Hot/Spicy than McCormick's Brand
review/text: My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.<br /><br />I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more.

review/summary: Ahmad Loose Imperial Blend Tea is great for the price
review/text: A friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago. Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound. At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think it's great. I've been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc. Most of them were over $30/lb. with shipping. Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest. Has everything I'm looking for in a strong, full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring. My current favorite afternoon tea. Unless you're extremely jaded or a tea snob, you'll love it.

review/summary: Nice tea
review/text: I love strong, full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam, irish breakfast or early grey tea, but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging. So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasn't bitter at a more palatable price point, and this certainly fits the bill. And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another, i.e. iced vs. hot, this tea is excellent in both forms. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesn't cost an arm and leg.

review/summary: A fragrant tea
review/text: I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store.  One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma.  So the label "Imperial Blend" kind of implied the herb.<br /><br />I am not exactly a black tea drinker, so this tea is a surprise, and affordable too.  I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature water.  But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the 'softness' of white tea.

review/summary: Best Ahmad Tea
review/text: I've tried a variety of Ahmad tea. Not because I particularly like this brand, but they are just easier to come across.  The Imperial blend, I believe, is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I've tried. It's full body like a good cup of Assam, which by no means overpower the delightful, clean taste of Darjeerling, complete with a long lasting note of bergamot. I enjoy it best in the evening. It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.<br /><br />For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication.

review/text: I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.  I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly. My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too.

The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess. I made it with snow peas and carrots only. I dont like the little corn.  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice.  It came out wonderful! Dinner on the table in less than 30mins.

review/summary: Taste is neutral, quantity is DECEITFUL!
review/text: The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.<br /><br />What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.<br /><br />What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavor.

I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods.  My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON.com.

review/summary: High Quality... But it gave my dog wicked gas..
review/text: The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.

review/text: I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.<br />This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse.

review/summary: If you can't handle caffeine, this is not for you.
review/text: Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!

review/summary: Great for Gluten-free lifestyle!!
review/text: Had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten-free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets. Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs.  Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking, too. Good product, good value.

review/summary: Manufacturing Problems Diminish Product
review/text: I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years, after being introduced to it in a Starbucks. My most recent purchase, however, was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a "1" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a "51A"). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, I'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw.

review/summary: Lie!!!!
review/text: I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.

review/summary: Excellent but not perfect
review/text: This is a delicious sugar. It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer.

review/text: Can't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw.  I like it better than the other "natural" sugars. Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the "natural" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.  It didn't look like the box was damaged so I can't tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.  Not sure what the solution is and I'd order it again, but if it happens again, I'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag.

review/text: Please ignore the one-star comments, if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower. With anything that is gluten free you have to add another "binder" which is where the corn flour comes in. For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips, because they contain wheat (a key binder to any chip, cookie or cereal) this is an excellent product. My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious!

review/text: I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a "good" carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have "Masa corn flour" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste.

review/summary: Rotel saves me on a daily basis
review/text: I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so much--it saves me on a daily basis.  If you're trying to cook lower fat, healthier foods and in a HURRY, this stuff makes it so much easier.  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird "tin can" taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever?  For some reason this product doesn't have that.  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans, heat and eat.<br /><br />or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup.  I also make indian dishes with this, and spicey spaghetti sauce.  I also prefer this to most canned salsas, so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off.<br /><br />None of my local grocery stores carry it at all, nor do they carry anything like it.  So I have to pay Amazon's inflated price to order this by the case.  I don't like that I'm paying a higher price, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product.

(In Texas I was called a "baby-mouth" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)<br /><br />For comparison, I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though.

review/summary: Great Natural Energy
review/text: This is a fantastic product, and I wish it was readily available in most stores. It's taste is not the greatest, but it's a 2.5 oz. shot, and it's gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results.

And the price is ok, on Amazon anyway. At my grocery store they were almost $3 each, yike!<br /><br />And it's organic--so I can feel good about it, right? It's all about me feeling good!

review/text: I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I don't like the taste of either of them! This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better. I like them cold for sure. My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we don't have to make stops for coffee! Especially on the turnpikes where it's just way too expensive. It's worth the $[...] per shot. We normally split them. I'm really sensitive to caffeine, even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that's the same for coffee too for me. My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost. I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there. You can feel good about putting this in your body! I'll be ordering again soon for sure =)

So, I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market, for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the day.<br /><br />She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle. Over three hours after drinking whatever that was, my brain is still working at unnatural speeds. To summarize my experiences: I believe this works.<br /><br />She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it, which I personally feel helped the energy level. So if you're feeling tired during the day and hate coffee, give this a shot - preferably before you eat anything.<br /><br />Woot!

review/summary: Best energy shot I have ever tasted!
review/text: I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market. I bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. I fell in love instantly. The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.<br />It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price. I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon. I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product, hah!

review/text: Products takes pretty good, and it doesn't leave you gittery.  With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below $ 2 a shot.  My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style.  I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink.

review/summary: Flavor getting better, energy is great
review/text: I've been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, ~6-hour effect. The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps I'm getting more used to it. I don't drink it for the flavor, but it's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, non-organic energy shots.

review/text: This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail

review/text: Try this you might like it. I did and I am quite addicted, it is too easy to prepare, it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with. The price is really good and well worth the purchase. If you like this type of Couscous like I do, then give this one a try.It can be eaten hot, room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors, it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed. I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time. I will be back for more.

review/text: I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon.  I like this so much that this my first product review.  I have to say that I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I would give it a try.  When my husband started grinding it up, I could smell it throughout the house.  Sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste isn't.  However, not with this one.  I'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try.

review/text: This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time -- I've believe the company is local.  I've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it.  I'm particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good.  I can't say that I've had a bad one.<br /><br />As it turns out, it's less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it.  It's a no brainer.  Try it, if you like rich, flavored coffee, you'll like it.

review/summary: Hot and delicious
review/text: I consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  It is hot, but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me; I thought maybe I'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera.  It's hot enough that people who aren't used to it will say "That's hot!".<br /><br />Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  I don't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).<br /><br />A drawback is La Victoria doesn't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sam's Club.  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales.

review/text: These creamers come in 4 packs of 25. I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far, and haven't found a single broken or leaking creamer yet. I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee, but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I won't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup. I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping!

review/summary: Better Packaging
review/text: Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers, I liked this item specifically because of packaging. I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable.

review/text: I have a slightly different version of this - different brand.  My son started using it around six months, and he really enjoys it.  He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever...  Anyway, I also had trouble cleaning it, until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush.  That works pretty well.  It takes some time, but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender, or cut it up, then clean it up off him, the chair, the floor, the dog, me, well you get the picture.

The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some don't cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.  While I love this product, I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags.

review/text: I've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix (which is a great product, by the way).  This is the highest price I've seen.  Whole Foods carries this item and it's been on sale there for $9.99 (that's Canadian dollars, too, as I'm in Canada).  It's even cheaper on Baker's Box's own website, and they're the company selling this product through Amazon. For a two-pack they should be charging $20 or less.  What gives?  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices.

(A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid.

review/summary: A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee...
review/text: When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors. Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!

Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go.

review/summary: Excellent flavor, mostly large pieces
review/text: I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms. They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend.

review/text: I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online - even ordering the smaller 1-3oz bags. I will admit, I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good (or bad) the cashews would be...<br /><br />The order came in pretty fast - like 3 days. The cashews were fresh and whole - with like 10 broken pieces. They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape.. first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal; considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them. The trick is to actually keep them in an air-tight box so that they stay fresh longer.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt $5.00 for the 10lb since I bought them.

review/text: Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix.  It tastes great, cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make.  Although it can be made using water, I think it's better made with milk.  I love it with pure organic maple syrup.

review/text: Perhaps the worst bottle of wine I've ever had. I'm not even sure I would cook with this. It is thin, no body, and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot.  The taste is just bitter - not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price. Just not what I'm looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir. Maybe my bottle wasn't sealed well and went to vinegar - other reviews for this wine are favorable.

review/summary: minty flavor
review/text: This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup I've ever had so far.  The others pale in flavor by comparison.  There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor.  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale.  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream. There are only 110 calories.  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste, I use it sparingly, so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used.

review/text: This is a simple product and it is simply good.  There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are.  It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup, so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out.  This will be great for people who like mint, it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate.  I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half, tastes great.  Sometimes simple is better.

review/summary: Excellent tea!
review/text: This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant. It's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way, with a lot of water and a bit of milk. This is very creamy and tasty. My only criticism is that there aren't enough sachets in the box. Only 10. Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But it's a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box.

review/text: The thing about Marmite is that those who don't like it hate it, and those who love it can't live without it.  It's very much "an English thing" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in "Victoria Beckham is Marmite" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.).  Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price.  Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England.  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).  Good job, Amazon!

review/text: After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

review/summary: Ridiculously Good
review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

review/summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review/text: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

review/text: For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/summary: A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor
review/text: I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!

review/summary: Convenience at low cost
review/text: I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!

No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)

review/summary: Excellent Thai-flavored chip
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.

review/text: In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.

review/text: Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.  But this is very simple and delicious.  Probably one of their best flavors.<br /><br />Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn't compromise on taste, eco-friendly business that isn't just giving us lip service<br /><br />Cons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open.  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag.  Use scissors instead.

review/text: I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.

review/text: My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however.

review/text: I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.

review/text: I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.

review/text: These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.

review/summary: Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!
review/text: Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.

The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me...

The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you).  They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own.  Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.  It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again.  Mmmmm... vinegar...

review/summary: Maybe the worst chips ever.
review/text: These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case "& Chive") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips.

review/summary: Love at first bite!  Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!
review/text: I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except "sweets," of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...<br /><br />Have I told you how much I love them?<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />Millennium Babe: The Prophecy

review/text: You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best.

review/summary: Chip snob alert!
review/text: It feels strange to review chips, but I am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips. Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly salted.<br /><br />They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag, plus they often looked burned. They are not actually burned. It has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark. I love to open a bag and find some browned chips.<br /><br />Lays and Wise have their place but I've become a chip snob thanks to Kettle.<br /><br />Like Edy's or Breyer's ice cream, some products are worth the money. These are the best of the best.

review/summary: Gourmet powerful Salt & Vinegar chips!
review/text: Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the "soft" end of the "soft/crunchy" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!

review/summary: They changed the Chips now they taste horrible
review/text: I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  "What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes "cheaper". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."  I did receive a reply: "Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the "best before" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help."  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the "bad" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...

review/text: Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didn't put them out because the buffet was full and didn't think anyone would like saltless potato chips.  Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out.  OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD!  I was so wrong to think they would be bland; they are full of real potato flavor, wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting.  I am here on amazon to buy a case, I only want to have these with dips.  Truly delicious!

review/summary: Best Chips out there!!!
review/text: I have tried Herrs, UTZ, wise, pringles, lays etc....but Kettle tasted the best. The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.<br /><br />Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon.

review/summary: Kettle Chips
review/text: Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.<br />M. Martin

review/text: I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the "One Star" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of "United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the "Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a "Potato Chip Diet".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!

review/text: Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips.  These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.  The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt.  Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste, you will not like these chips.<br /><br />I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste, so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty.

review/summary: Kettle has sold out, the chips are horrible now
review/text: Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label "yeast extract".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.

review/summary: The bags were damaged with holes and stains.
review/text: The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.<br /><br />The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette.

review/summary: Kettle Chips Make Great Mouse Food
review/text: After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse.  Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch.  When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon.  The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which.  I will never buy these again from Amazon.  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase.  It makes me sick to think about it!<br /><br />I included pictures at the top of the page.  Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.<br /><br />Update:  I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them.

review/text: Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented.  I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice, a veritable cornucopia of flavor.  I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai & Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors, alternating days. I have already lost 5 lbs, not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing. Get your life back - with Kettle Chips.
